**Question**
For each of the below invocations, list:
- the number of loop iterations,
- the minimal cost,
- and a shortest path (i.e. a path having minimal cost).

After completing each task, you can fill in more data here.

Task 2: Word ladder
-------------------

**Question**
What's the asymptotic average-case complexity of WordLadder.outgoingEdges in the alphabet size K and the length N of the given word?

TODO

Tasks 3 and 4: The A* algorithm, Guessing the cost
--------------------------------------------------

**Question**
For each of the three classes GridGraph, WordLadder, and NPuzzle, what is the approximate improvement factor in the number of loop iterations by running A* instead of UCS?
Try a number of different examples per class.

**Question**
For which of the three classes GridGraph, WordLadder, and NPuzzle, did the heuristic guessCost have the most impact?
What do you think is the reason for this?
